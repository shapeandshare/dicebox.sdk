# Dicebox SDK
               Let's shake things up!

Overview
--------
An image classification and training system built with SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) in mind.  The project includes several client implementations, and future enhancements will continue to expand the API capabilities.

1. **Visual Image Classification**

    Dicebox is a visual classification system.  It can be reconfigured for different image sizes and categories.

2. **Evolutionary Neural Network**

    Dicebox is capable of being applied to a large variety of classification problems.  Sometimes unique or novel problems need to be solved and a neural network structure is unknown.  In this case dicebox provides a means to evolve a network tailored to the particular problem.

3. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
   
*   The trained neural network is accessed through a REST API.  
*   The Web Client (and supervised trainer) stores data to an AWS EFS via the REST API.
*   The Trainer uses the REST API for training data



High Level Components
---------------------

![Dicebox Services Diagram](https://github.com/shapeandshare/dicebox.sdk/raw/master/assets/Dicebox%20Services%20Diagram.png)

* **Client**

    There are several client implementations included with dicebox.
    * [webcam](https://github.com/shapeandshare/dicebox.sdk/tree/master/webcam) is the recommend client for most use cases.  It is a simple html5/css/javascript client and supervised training program.
    * dicebox_test_client.py - meant for bulk image classification and trained network validation.
    * (_legacy_) dicebox_client.py - a python opencv thick client and supervised training program
    * (_legacy_) dicebox_multi_client.py - like the dicebox_client.py but classifies several portions of the screen.

* **Lonestar Trainer**

    The stand-alone training application for a selected network genotype.  It will generate weights files for use by the dicebox service.
    
* **Classification Service**
    
    A REST API that performs classification using the designated network structure and weights.
    
* **Sensory Service**

    The sensory service is a REST API that will store data that needs to be added to training set for a given classification.  It is primary consumed by the stand-alone trainer.

    Provides input data directly for small batch sizes, or can queue up large batch orders for creation by the batch processor.
 
* **Sensory Batch Processor**

    A back-end service for batch order processing.  Will take requests from the message queue, and then create a corresponding queue with data for a consumer.

* **Training Service**

    The training service is a REST API used to request training.

* **Training Processor Service**

    A back-end service for picking up a training request, and performing the training.


Requirements
------------

**Python Module Requirements**

The requirements can be automatically installed using the below command:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configuration
=============
`dicebox.config` contains the configurable parameters for dicebox.

The below section controls the parameters for the network input.
```
[DATASET]
    name = dicebox
    image_width = 100
    image_height = 100
    categories = 19
```

Images are expected to be in the below directory structure.
```
(dataset_base_directory)\
    (name)_(width)x(height)\
        data\
            (category_1)\
            (category_2)\
            [..]
```

The genotypes for the networks (individuals) are defined below; and can be changed. :)
```
[TAXONOMY]
    neurons: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597]

The Primordial Pool
===================
Based on the defined hyper-parameters evolutionary optimization is employed to select for successive generations of neural networks.  

```
    python ./primordialpool.py
```

Lonestar Training
=================
Allows for the saving of specific networks pulled from the pool.  The trained weights will be saved for use later.
```
    python ./lonestar_train.py
```

Classification Serrvice
===============
Provides an end-point that performs classifications via REST API calls.

**Start the service (development only):**
```
    python ./dicebox_service.py
```

**Production Deployment**

I've tested running dicebox with uwsgi, and proxied through nginx.  Nginx configurations can be found within ./nginx of this repository.
```
uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:5000 --manage-script-name --mount /=dicebox_service.py --plugin python,http --enable-threads --callable app —master
```


Dicebox Service API

### Authentication Required End-Points


**Request Header**

The below end-points require several headers to be present on the request.

```
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'API-ACCESS-KEY': 'String',
    'API-VERSION': 'String'
```

* API-ACCESS-KEY: 'A unique (secret) guid used for authorization'
* API-VERSION: 'Version of the API to use'

Used to classify the image data.  Return the label index for the classification.


```
    [POST] /api/classify
```
Post Body: `{ "data": "Base64 encoded PNG image" }`

Result: `{ "classification": integer }`


Example
```
    {
        "classification": 7
    }

```
* **Get Categories**

 Used to turn classification results into human-readable labels.

```
    [GET] /api/categories
```
Result: A list of label to index mappings.

Example

```
    {
        "category_map": {
            "0": "1d4_1",
            "1": "1d4_2",
            "2": "1d4_3",
            "3": "1d4_4",
            "4": "1d6_1",
            "5": "1d6_2",
            "6": "1d6_3",
            "7": "1d6_4",
            "8": "1d6_5",
            "9": "1d6_6",
            "10": "unknown"
        }
    }
```



Sensory Service
===============
Provides an end-point that performs input data storage and retrieval via REST API calls.

**Start the service (development only):**
```
    python ./sensory_service.py
```

**Production Deployment**

I've tested running the sensory service with uwsgi, and proxied through nginx.  Nginx configurations can be found within ./nginx of this repository.
```
uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:5000 --manage-script-name --mount /=sensory_service.py --plugin python,http --enable-threads --callable app —master
```

* Stores data with classifications that are sent to it from the client/supervisored trainer.
* Provides data sets for the stand-alone trainer while building the weights.
    * For small batches of the data a single API call can be used.  
    * For large batches a batch order is created and the trainer polls the sensory service to get all the training data. (The sensory service pulls the data off a RabbitMQ queue with a matching batch order id.)


Sensory Service Batch Processor
===============================

A worker service that processes batch orders from a RabbitMQ task queue, and publishes back for a consumer.

**Start the service:**
```
    python ./sensory_service_batch_processor.py
```
The service reads data for the datasets off an AWS EFS which can be shared amoungst a large number of workers.


Client Consumption
==================
Sample client application.  Useful for supervised training.

[![Dicebox 60x50 Dataset Real-Time Image Classification Demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/01MML66v4-U/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01MML66v4-U)

```
    python ./legacy/dicebox_client.py
```

A simple test harness for running the datasets against the dicebox service.
```
    python ./dicebox_test_client.py
```


Mission Statement / Why
-----------------------
I set out on this adventure in the hope that one day I can play Dungeons and Dragons live online and have REAL dice involved.

There are lots of great programs with shared dice rollers in them. There's even VR, and augmented reality.  I know.


But, what I want is the real deal.  I want to be able grab my die, roll it, and have the experience shared easily.

Specifically, I want something:
* Real-time 
* Easy to use
* Able to use any camera and viewing angle available
* Usable by more than a single person
* Not require special/expensive setups
* Easy to connect to other applications, services, or devices
* Be beautiful (filled with as much love, art, and beauty that I can)
* Be magical (be of sufficiently advanced technology as to be indistinguishable from magic)
* Be itself a device/system that can stand alone with the above stated abilities


Dicebox has come through a number of iterations to get to where it is today.  I suspect it will probably have more, and may even evolve beyond anything I have yet to image. ;)


Data Sets
---------
[Download](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/diceboximages/dist/dicebox_60x50.070817.tar.gz)
 | Dicebox Dataset 60x50 | approx 265k  gray scale png images of 1d4 and 1d6 dices.


### The creation the dataset
Using the below equipment and the supervised training program the images were generated over successive sessions.

#### Equipment

* [Polaroid 8" Heavy Duty Mini Tripod](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OAFO0I/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Rotating Display Turntable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0144DMXEO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [DragonSteel Solid Metal Polyhedral 7 Die D&D Dice Set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LW6QSFX/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


Weights
-------
[Download](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/diceboxweights/weights.epoch_224.final.2017-07-12_16_26_10_253809.hdf5.tar.gz) | 
Dicebox weights trained on the above dataset.

To use the weights file, download and extract into the `./weights` directory.  By default the service will look for a weights file named `weights.best.hdf5`.  You'll want to rename/copy this file or update the relavent setting within the `dicebox.config` file.

**dicebox.config settings for the above sample weights file**
```
[DATASET]
categories = 11
image_width = 60
name = dicebox
image_height = 50
```
```
[LONESTAR]
neurons = 987
layers = 3
activation = elu
optimizer = adam
```

#### Equipment
Training was done with Tensorflow configured to use a GeForce 1080.
